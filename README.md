# TEMPERATURE CLOSEST TO ZERO EXERCISE

Find the temperature
In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.

Sample temperatures. Here, -1.7 is the closest to 0.
Implement the method closestToZero to return the temperature closer to zero which belongs to the array ts.
If ts is empty, return 0 (zero). If two numbers are as close to zero, consider the positive number as the closest to zero (eg. if ts contains -5 and 5, return 5).
Input:
Temperatures are always expressed with floating point numbers ranging from -273 to 5526. ts is never null.
